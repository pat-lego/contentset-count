# AEM project

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* [core:](core/README.md) Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.

## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

## Documentation

The build process also generates documentation in the form of README.md files in each module directory for easy reference. Depending on the options you select at build time, the content may be customized to your project.

### Unit tests

This show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To
test, execute:

    mvn clean test

## Maven settings

The project comes with the auto-public repository configured. To setup the repository in your Maven settings, refer to:
